- who should have an actionUI? The team so that there is only one to manage?
    - Each character so that they can be partitioned easily with their designated actionButton?
    - Or should the offenseState and defenseState of each character get their own ActionUI?

    - Difficult to decide right now because testing takes place with a team of only a single member :(

    - If the team should have an actionUI then we need to split the team into CharacterTeam and EnemyTeam subclasses because the different kinds of teams behave differently
