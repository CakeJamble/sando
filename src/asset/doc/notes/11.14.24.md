- ActionUI:
    - The ActionUI class has a ton of variables that make it less modular than desired for testing and rapid changing
        - Ton of variables, static variables, and variables that depend on other variables (within the class, low cohesion)
        - Action Buttons (Solo, Flour, Duo) should be their own objects that inehrit from a Button base class
        - The ActionUI should be composed of these buttons, so that I can remove a lot of the complex logic, and focus on the functionality.
